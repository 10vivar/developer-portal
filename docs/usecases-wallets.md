Kyber Network gives your wallet the power to do more. By integrating with Kyber Network, it allows users to freely transact and convert without leaving your app. Fee sharing is applicable on each trade that originates from your wallet.

The below diagram shows how Kyber Network can streamline the token conversion swap process for your users.
