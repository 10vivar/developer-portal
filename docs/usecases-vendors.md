Projects such as Gifto and Request Network will be taking advantages of Kyber’s technology to allow payments in a wide range of tokens and currencies.

Vendors have the opportunity to join our Affiliate Program, which allows fee sharing on each payment that originates from your payment gateway. You can visit [here](MiscellaneousGuide#affiliate-program) to learn more about the program.
